## Flow Chart 
- This is the original draft flow chart for the project, I wanted to make multiple branches to tell the story
- A few branches have been changed but the premise is still the same

- This is the re-done flow chart to show how to get to each branch ending and how they were labeled throughout to ensure the proper structure could be followed making it in gitpod
- Some of the text has been changed from the original draft but this is the final chart to help reach all endings

 ## Testing
- Issues faced

- Deployment Issues
    - Issues I had faced after deployment of website was that all hyperlinks were broken and giving a 404 message.
    Through slack and very helpful individuals in my course I finally spotted the issue which was a foward slash on my hyperlinks causing the 404 error. I removed them and pushed the website which solved the issue.

- Summary
    - In relation to testing the feedback provided from the participants was extremely useful in the development of the media queries and the pages overall funtionality. 


### Validator Testing 
- I used PEP8 to validate my python code.
- I manually tested every section of the game to make sure it played well
  and all the decision branches lined up well.
